				    Competing against a well-known brand managed by a Fortune 500 company, Red Vines was facing significant competitive headwinds.  However, the brand still had goals of expanding outside of its core markets and realize its vision of growing market share.
				</div>
                <br>
				<div> 
				    To assist, we developed an overarching strategy to defend share by re-positioning and relaunching the brand, basing the new direction on key consumer insights.  In conjunction, we developed a robust innovation strategy that included the launch of a new sub-brand to meet the needs of consumers as Red Vines expands distribution outside of its core markets.  
				</div> 
                <br>
                <div>

Developing an omni-channel support system for its customers would be key, but questions arose on what that would look like.
